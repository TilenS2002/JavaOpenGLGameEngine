# JavaOpenGLGameEngine
 learning OpenGL & Java gamedev

The purpose of this repo is learning and making a game engine using the LWJGL 3 framework. Post creation, I might use it to make games. Currently the main goal is to get familiar with shaders and general graphics programing. Aquired knowledge will be applied to my Diploma theesis, where the project being worked on will be written with the WebGPU graphics API.
